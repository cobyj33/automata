# This file acts as a guideline for the layout and structure of the automata project

Everything in this is subject to change as the complexity of the project builds, such as adding other pages, adding databases, etc... but should conform to this guideline in its current state

First, this project is created with Vite, so as with all Vite projects, there is a public and src folder
The src folder acts as the baseURL for tsconfig, and is where most of everything should be done

- index.tsx should be left untouched
- globals.css should not be modified unless there is a really good reason
