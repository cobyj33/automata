## Version History

### 0.2

Complete visual overhaul, Easier rule manipulation, new generation algorithm.

Still missing many key features like brush size, saving, setting patterns, etc...

### 0.1

Initial Release, supports both life-like and elementary cellular automata but is not the prettiest or most user friendly of ui's and controls
